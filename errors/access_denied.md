### access_denied

This error occurs when the user denied consent to a resource you're trying to access.     

**Possible causes**

* You tried accessing a resource the user hasn't given you consent to access yet.
* You tried accessing a resource the user revoked consent to.
* The user's account was not found or dissabled.
* A conditional access request failed.

* The user's device authentication failed.

**What to do**

Notify the user you cannot continue without consent from them, then reprompt them and have an exit option if they do not want to consent.
